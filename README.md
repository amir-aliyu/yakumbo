# Plant Watering App
## CSDS393
This is the demo of our web app!
[View the live demo here!](https://csds393.onrender.com/)
## Setup Guide
* Start by cloning the repository to a folder on your computer. Then, run `npm install` from the terminal in both the **frontend** and **backend** directories. Run the start commands described below simultaneously in two separate terminal instances and then navigate to localhost:3000 to view the front-end application in your browser! 

* Your changes will update automatically--no need to restart the node server. Also, all changes pushed to the main branch will trigger an automatic redeployment of the live demo.

* The backend directory additionally requires a .env file (containing *ATLAS_URI* and *PORT* properties) that is not provided here because of security concerns


## Start Commands
Frontend:
* `cd frontend`  
* `npm start`

Backend:
* `cd backend`  
* `npm start`
