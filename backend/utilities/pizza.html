    <h1>Homemade Pizza Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Assorted toppings:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>Sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>Sliced bell peppers</li>
            <li>Sliced onions</li>
            <li>Sliced olives</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Other favorite toppings</li>
        </ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (for brushing)</li>
        <li>Cornmeal or flour (for dusting)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface into your desired shape (round, rectangular, etc.).</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet that has been dusted with cornmeal or flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Spoon pizza sauce onto the dough and spread it evenly, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, covering the entire pizza.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings, distributing them evenly over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Brush the exposed edges of the dough with olive oil to help them brown in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven, either directly onto the pizza stone or onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Variations:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you like a crispy crust, pre-bake the dough for a few minutes before adding toppings.</li>
        <li>For a healthier option, use whole wheat or cauliflower crust.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different cheeses such as cheddar, provolone, or goat cheese.</li>
        <li>Add a drizzle of balsamic glaze or sprinkle of red pepper flakes for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>
