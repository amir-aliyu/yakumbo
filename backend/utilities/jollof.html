    <h1>Nigerian Jollof Rice Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For the pepper mix</li>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium bell peppers</li>
            <li>5 medium tomatoes roma</li>
            <li>2 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For frying</li>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil or oil of choice</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>18 oz tomato paste (not tomato sauce)</li>
            <li>2 knorr seasoning cubes or 2 teaspoons crushed bullion cube powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp thyme</li>
            <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>2½ cup rich chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>8 cups rice</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil meat with onion, garlic salt, seasoning cube, thyme, curry. You can use beef, chicken, turkey, goat meat etc. I use chicken for this recipe.</li>
        <li>While meat is boiling, blend tomatoes, bell peppers, onion until smooth.</li>
        <li>Transfer pepper mix to a wide pot and boil until reduced (about 15 minutes depending on how much water was used to blend peppers).</li>
        <li>When meat is cooked, separate from stock, fry, grill, or air-fry meat until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Wash rice multiple times until water runs clear. Set aside (see notes on type of rice).</li>
        <li>In a large wide pot, heat up vegetable oil or oil of choice.</li>
        <li>Fry chopped onion until onion is translucent and fragrant. Add tin tomato/tomato paste (different from tomato sauce). Fry tomato paste for about 15 minutes until it looks grainy. (Frying the tomato paste gets rid of the tangy taste).</li>
        <li>Add boiled down pepper mix, season with salt, curry, thyme, bay leaves. Fry for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add meat stock or water. Stir.</li>
        <li>Add washed rice, cover with foil and allow to cook for about 20 minutes (cook time also depends on the kind of rice being used. See note 2).</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, your rice should be ready. If you want the authentic part jollof taste, cook on high heat for the first 25 minutes, reduce heat and let rice absorb the Smokey flavor generated from the burnt rice.</li>
        <li>Open foil, turn rice to release steam. If rice seems dry, add 3 teaspoons of butter, allow to melt with the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve with chicken, fried plantain, and salad.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Note 1:</strong> Nigerian jollof is traditionally prepared with long grain parboiled rice. Par excellence rice, golden canilla, zatarain are good brands.</li>
        <li><strong>Note 2:</strong> Covering with foil helps trap most of the steam in the pot. This helps the rice cook with less water and prevents mushy rice.</li>
    </ul>
